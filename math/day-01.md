## Key definitions
- **Mathematical definition of a vector**: Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction, typically represented as an ordered pair or triplet of numbers in 2D or 3D space, respectively.
- **Vector addition**: The process of adding two vectors by adding their corresponding components.
- **Scalar multiplication**: The operation of multiplying a vector by a scalar (a real number), which scales the vector's magnitude without changing its direction.
- **Dot product**: A mathematical operation that takes two vectors and returns a scalar, calculated as the sum of the products of their corresponding components.
- **Cross product**: A mathematical operation that takes two vectors in three-dimensional space and returns a vector that is perpendicular to both, with a magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the original vectors.

- **Unit vector**: A vector with a magnitude of 1, often used to indicate direction.

- **Magnitude of a vector**: The length or size of a vector, calculated using the Pythagorean theorem for 2D and 3D vectors.

- **Direction of a vector**: The orientation of a vector in space, often represented by the angle it makes with a reference axis.

- **Vector projection**: The operation of projecting one vector onto another, resulting in a vector that lies along the direction of the second vector.

- **Basis vectors**: A set of vectors that define a coordinate system, typically orthogonal and of unit length.

- **Linear combination**: An expression constructed from a set of vectors by multiplying each vector by a scalar and then adding the results.

- **Orthogonal vectors**: Vectors that are perpendicular to each other, meaning their dot product is zero.

- **Vector space**: A mathematical structure formed by a collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars, satisfying certain axioms. 

- **Span**: The set of all possible linear combinations of a given set of vectors, representing the space that those vectors can cover.

- **Basis**: A set of linearly independent vectors that span a vector space, allowing any vector in that space to be expressed as a unique linear combination of the basis vectors.

## Key formulas


## Vectors in Machine Learning (ML)
Are ordered arrays of numbers representing data points, acting as the foundational, numerical input for algorithms. They encode complex information—words, images, or audio—as high-dimensional coordinates, allowing models to calculate relationships and similarities.
